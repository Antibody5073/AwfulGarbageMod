[b]This mod does not support multiplayer[/b]
This mod also adds a structure and some ore, so a new world is recommended (though you can manually generate them on the spot using an item if needed)

Awful Garbage Mod is a mod I have created to just add whatever I want into Terraria, it is also the first Terraria mod I have ever created. While I have "plans" for the mod, they mostly just exist so I feel like I am making progress.

Currently adds 260+ items and 10 NPCs, mostly in pre-Hardmode. This includes: 
121 weapons
A new type of magic weapon, Scepters, which create orbital projectiles that grant buffs while orbiting. Taking damage releases all orbiting projectiles.
10 tools
9 armor sets + 1 helmet for a vanilla set
78 accessories

4 bosses + 1 boss minion
4 enemies
1 town NPC

This mod balance changes a few vanilla items, this can be managed in the configs

Has support/cross mod content for:
Boss Checklist
Census
Stram's Classes (This includes: 1 armor set, 9 weapons)

Coders: 
Antibody

Spriters: 
Kevimipenem

Music: 
Antibody
JynX(For making the original music for the Len'en bosses, the music for those bosses in this mod are remixes)

Other:
This mod has a lot of Len'en related content, especially Len'en 3: Reactivate majestical imperial
Some items in this mod are from the game Necesse
Some items are Touhou references
Some items are Marble Siege references
