[b]This mod does not support multiplayer[/b]
This mod also adds a structure and some ore, so a new world is recommended (though you can manually generate them on the spot using an item if needed)

Awful Garbage Mod is a mod I have created to just add whatever I want into Terraria, it is also the first Terraria mod I have ever created. While I have "plans" for the mod, they mostly just exist so I feel like I am making progress.

Currently adds 400+ items and 10 NPCs, mostly in pre-Hardmode. This includes: 
190 weapons
A new type of magic weapon, Scepters, which create orbital projectiles that grant buffs while orbiting. Taking damage releases all orbiting projectiles.
11 tools
14 armor sets + 1 helmet for a vanilla set
135 accessories

6 bosses + 1 boss minion
6 enemies
1 town NPC

This mod tweaks a few vanilla items, this can be managed in the configs
